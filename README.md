# Estimation of Misclassification Rates for Human and AI Reading Accuracy Measurements

**Overview**
This repository contains the source code and supplementary graphs and tables for my research poster titled "Estimation of Misclassification Rates for Human and AI Reading Accuracy Measurements". The poster was presented at the 2024 Student Research Symposium at Texas Christian University.

**Abstract**
Oral reading accuracy is crucial for assessing language proficiency in educational settings. This research quantifies misclassification rates between human and AI assessments of reading scores using speech recognition. The study breaks down misclassification rates into True Positive and True Negative components, based on whether the correct or incorrect words were identified by either human raters or an AI system. We employ binomial and Poisson distribution models to estimate misclassification rates, comparing scenarios with and without access to true scores. The effectiveness of these models is evaluated through a study involving elementary school students reading passages of varying lengths and difficulties.
